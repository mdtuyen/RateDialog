Rate-Me [![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-Rate--Me-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/1032)
=======

Rate Me is an Android library that shows dialog to suggest the user to rate the application in the Google Play Store.

With a little twist: if the rating is positive, we take the user to the Play Store directly. Otherwise, we ask him for feedback via email. (This is all configurable.)

How to integrate
================

Add this dependency in your `build.gradle`:

```xml
dependencies {
    compile 'com.androidsx:rate-me:4.0.3'
}
```

Find the latest version in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.androidsx%22%20AND%20a%3A%22rate-me%22).

How to use
==========

The simplest integration:

```java
new RateMeDialog.Builder(getPackageName())
        .enableFeedbackByEmail("email@example.com")
        .build()
        .show(getFragmentManager(), "plain-dialog");
```

Have a look at the sample project for other examples.

Automatic timer
---------------

You can make the dialog appear after a number of times your app has been opened or after a number of days after the install date:

```java
RateMeDialogTimer.onStart(this);
if (RateMeDialogTimer.shouldShowRateDialog(this, 7, 3)) {
	// show the dialog with the code above
}
```
